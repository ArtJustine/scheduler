# UI/UX Improvements Needed

## 1. Media Library Selection
**Issue**: Users cannot select existing media from the library when creating posts
**Solution**: Add a dialog/dropdown to select from uploaded media

## 2. Add Media Button Visibility
**Issue**: The "Add Media" button is not recognizable - just an icon
**Solution**: Make it a prominent button with text label "Add Media"

## 3. Dropdown Highlight Persistence
**Issue**: After selecting from Content Library dropdown, the blue highlight stays
**Solution**: Properly close dropdown and clear focus state

## 4. Sidebar Menu Highlighting Delay
**Issue**: When clicking sidebar menus, there's a delay before highlight moves
**Solution**: Reduce transition delay from 150ms to 50ms

## 5. Light Mode Visibility
**Issue**: Active menu item not visible in light mode
**Solution**: Ensure proper contrast for active state in light mode

## 6. Post Editing
**Issue**: Editing scheduled posts is not working
**Solution**: Need to investigate the edit post flow

## Files to Modify:
- `app/dashboard/create/page.tsx` - Add media library selection
- `components/dashboard/sidebar-fixed.tsx` - Fix highlighting delays
- `app/dashboard/post/[id]/page.tsx` - Fix post editing (if exists)
